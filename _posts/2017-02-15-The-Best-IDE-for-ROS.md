I have tried [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/), [QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/ide/), [Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/specials/clion/clion.html?&gclid=CjwKEAiAlZDFBRCKncm67qihiHwSJABtoNIgPAomPOm6xbKp2mfavGmu9fGtufYJ0GDqWtY7XtDNnhoC_q3w_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds.ds&dclid=CO6L18X9ktICFQqtTwodZNEIDQ) for c++ software development in ROS.  

CLion is my favorite IDE in terms of cmake based projects. For ROS or cmake based c++ projects, you can use clion out of box. If you have an university Email address, you can use CLion for free.  Here is the [registration link](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)


Also [Roboware](http://www.roboware.me/#/) is a new star among [IDEs for ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs). I haven't try it out yet, so I can't say much about it.  


The explaination of the configuration of clion is coming soon.
