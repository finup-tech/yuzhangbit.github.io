Hello! My name is Yu Zhang(张玉).  I am a PhD candidate working under the supervision of Prof. Huiyan Chen in School of Mechanical Engineering at Beijing Institute of Technology.
I was also a visiting student working under the supervision of [Prof. Steven L. Waslander](http://wavelab.uwaterloo.ca/?page_id=593) at [WAVELab](http://wavelab.uwaterloo.ca/) in University of Waterloo from 2015 to 2017.

My research interests cover the area of motion planning and control algorithms, simulation for autonomous cars. My focus is more about optimization-based and sampling-based motion planning algorithms subject to differential contraints.
I developed several handy simulation tools to support motion planning and control algorithms testing of autonomous driving system based on [V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) as well.

I am also a main contributor to several awesome autonomous driving projects from motion planning and simulation aspects: [Autonomoose](http://www.autonomoose.net/), [Skyline(Renesas Car)](https://www.renesas.com/en-us/about/press-center/news/2017/news201701042.html), [BlackBerry QNX Autonomous Prototype Vehicle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAjntsc8MR0).

In 2017, I attended the CES(Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas to show the functional safety, autonomy of our autonomous driving system running on low power consumption R-Car H3 SoC. It's a big success!
